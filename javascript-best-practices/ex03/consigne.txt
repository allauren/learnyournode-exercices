 ## Separation of Concerns 3 (Exercise 4 of 8)  
   
 # Separation of Concerns Part 3  
   
  This is the third and final exercise to display the concept of Separation  
  of Concerns.  
   
  We have already separated out all of the balance and change methods, so  
  the only ones left (besides the actual vending machine's) have to do with  
  products. Take the two methods that relate to products and move them into  
  productInventory.js.  
   
  Make sure that the new productInventory is now calling the functions, run  
  the tests, and you will have a Vending Machine whose concerns are fully  
  separated.

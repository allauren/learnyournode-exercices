 ## Fix Your Teammates' Mistakes (Exercise 7 of 8)  
   
  #Bad Practices  
   
  The goal of this exercise is to learn to be able to identify bad practices  
  in code. First, take the Best Practices Quiz located in the lower menu.  
  Then open balanceManager.js and fix all of the mistakes you find there.  
   
  Both of these exercises draw from the Javascript Best Practices Curriculum  
  which can be found here:  
  [https://github.com/excellalabs/the-javascript-curriculum](https://github.  
  com/excellalabs/the-javascript-curriculum). It might be a good idea to  
  look it over if you have not already.

 # Getting Rid of Switch Statements  
   
  Switch statements can be useful in simple cases, but they are often  
  considered "code smells" when used to branch into clauses of complex  
  logic. They also can be somewhat difficult to maintain compared to  
  alternative value-retriever constructs like dictionaries. All in all, it's  
  best to avoid switch statements if at all possible.  
   
  In this exercise, you should refactor the getAmount() method in  
  changeHandler.js to completely remove the switch method while retaining  
  its functionality. It doesn't matter what alternative you choose, but the  
  method should not use a switch statement in any way.

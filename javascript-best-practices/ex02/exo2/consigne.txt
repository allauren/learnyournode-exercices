 ## Separation of Concerns 2 (Exercise 3 of 8)  
   
 # Separation of Concerns Part 2  
   
  This is the second exercise to display the concept of Separation of  
  Concerns.  
   
  We have already separated out all of the balance related methods, now we  
  will look at the change related ones. Take the method that relates to  
  handling change and move it into changeHandler.js.  
   
  Just like last time, make sure that the new changeHandler is now calling  
  the function, run the tests, and you will have successfully integrated a  
  changeHandler into your Vending Machine.

 # Verify Vending Machine  
   
  Now that we've decomposed our initial JavaScript file into three separate,  
  self-contained classes, we should finally test the remaining methods that  
  act as the entry points into these classes' functionality. In practice,  
  you should always delegate specific functionality to its own service and  
  have a controller like vendingMachine.js orchestrate all the work that  
  these services do. If all has gone well, the only thing you should have to  
  do in this exercise is replace any this references with references to the  
  classes that call the methods.
